# InventoryPro - REST API Design Document

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the RESTful API architecture for InventoryPro, an inventory management system designed for 
African retail businesses. The design prioritizes simplicity, intuitiveness, and scalability, adhering to REST 
conventions with resource-oriented endpoints, proper HTTP semantics, and consistent error handling. The API is 
structured to support core inventory operations for products, categories, suppliers, and locations, with careful 
consideration given to the specific needs of multi-location retail management, such as tracking stock levels 
across different stores.
